This repository contains  
1. Inaugural project. 
2. Data project. To analyze the performance of the Danish economy over the past decade, we retrieve data from StatBank using an API. Subsequently, we make slight modifications to the data before plotting it, allowing for a comprehensive interpretation.
3. Model project. We fetch data from Jord√°-Schularick-Taylor Macrohistory Database of Sweden from 1994 to 2020. With this empirical evidence, we simulate and optimize an AS-AD model with floating exchange regime using Nelder-Mead Optimization.
4. The exam.
