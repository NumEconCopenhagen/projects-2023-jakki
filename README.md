This repository contains  
1. Inaugural project. 
2. Data project. To analyze the performance of the Danish economy over the past decade, we retrieve data from StatBank using an API. Subsequently, we make slight modifications to the data before plotting it, allowing for a comprehensive interpretation.
3. Model project. Using the Jord√°-Schularick-Taylor Macrohistory Database, we acquire relevant data of Sweden spanning from 1994 to 2020. Leveraging this empirical evidence, we proceed to simulate and optimize an AS-AD model with a floating exchange regime using Nelder-Mead Optimization.
4. The exam.
