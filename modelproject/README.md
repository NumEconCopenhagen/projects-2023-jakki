# Model analysis project

Our project is titled **AS-AD Model with a Floating Exchange Regime**. It involves presenting and analyzing data related to inflation and output for Sweden, which has had a floating exchange rate since 1993. We simulate an AS-AD model and use Nelder-Mead Optimization to identify a set of parameters that provide a good fit between the model and empirical evidence.

The **results** of the project can be seen from running [modelproject.ipynb](modelproject.ipynb).

Classes and functions in this project are presented in [modelproject.py](modelproject.py).

A standard Anaconda Python 3 installation and the following packages are required to run this project: 
from types import SimpleNamespace
from scipy import optimize
pandas
numpy
