# Data analysis project

Our project is titled "AS-AD Model with a Floating Exchange Regime." It involves presenting and analyzing data related to inflation and output for Sweden, which has had a floating exchange rate since 1993. We simulate an AS-AD model and use Nelder-Mead Optimization to identify a set of parameters that provide a good fit between the model and empirical evidence.

The **results** of the project can be seen from running [dataproject.ipynb](dataproject.ipynb).

dataproject.py is also required to run and simulate the model.

We apply the **following dataset**:

1. EmpiricalData.csv from Jord√°-Schularick-Taylor Macrohistory Database 

A standard Anaconda Python 3 installation is enough for this project.
